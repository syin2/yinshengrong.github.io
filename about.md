  Hey there! I use Jekyll, Github Pages and Poole to make this page a reality.

Thanks to [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [@joshualande](https://twitter.com/joshualande), this page went alive.

I am now a graduate student at the [University of Houston](http://www.uh.edu) working on Dualband Wireless project. in the [Networked Systems Laboratory](http://nsl.cs.uh.edu). Currently, I am advised by [Prof. Omprakash Gnawali](http://www2.cs.uh.edu/~gnawali).
