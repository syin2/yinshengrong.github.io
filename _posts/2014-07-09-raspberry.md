 title: Raspberry Pi Password Reset
---

Sometime I saw [this](http://makezine.com/projects/make-38-cameras-and-av/raspberry-pirate-radio/) on the Internet and fortunately we had a Raspberry Pi device in our lab. I was thinking maybe I can transformt the device into a FM transmitter so that I can use it in my old car.

When I powered on the Raspberry Pi, the default login and password which are pi and raspberry can not be authenticated by the system. In order to fix this, I tried to search the net for a while about how to reset the password of the user. As there is no gub interface built for Raspberry, I have no idea until I find a useful suggestion in the Raspberry Pi [forum](http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=20397&p=483614&hilit=reset+the+passwd#p483614).
