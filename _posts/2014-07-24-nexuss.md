Since we have Nexus S in our lab, we definitely want to use it as the data collection device. Considering the OS on that device is still android 4.0. We tried to upgrade it to 4.1.1(jelly bean) so that it can run the application with no error. We did the following thing to upgrade:

* Download the app [Nexus Update Check](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ethanfirst.nexusupdatechecker&hl=en) on Google Play.
* Grant the root access on Mac for Nexus S, Click [here](http://nexusshacks.com/nexus-s-root/how-to-root-nexus-s-or-nexus-s-4g-on-ics-or-gingerbread/) for how.
