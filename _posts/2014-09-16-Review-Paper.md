  *Questions I have when I read related paper in current top WSN conference?
   When we deploy the sensor network. is there any guidelines for the design flow? Applying current platforms to sensor network in different environments, is there any common knowledge? Apparently, sensor networks integrates both theoretical and practical issues when we try to design and implement, such as network topology design, protocol design, platform choice, architecture flexibility, etc. Right now, I see no common principles can be applied into so many different scenarios. At this point, I wonder the event-driven would be the core for sensor networks. Duty cycled percentage will definitely a key metric to evaluate the performance of the deployment and network energy consumption. Suppose we have 500 sensors, why, where and how we are going to deploy them? The scenarios is quite imaginative. People have already deployed sensors in the forests, the ocean, the industrial environment, the oil storage, the city, or even the agriculture field. In this case, is there any special requirement to deploy them? Campus wifi are deployed because mobile network is rushing and people need the internet everywhere in the campus. It is something like infrastructure. For sensor networks, what we can do at this point? This generalization is too abstract and not specific. In the deployment process, we need to think about a small or even narrow topic to think about.
