poster: Low-Power Wireless Channel Quality Estimation in the Presence of RF Smog
1. What is the problem?
Low power wireless will be affected by the other RF techonologies operating in  
crowded ISM bands giving their scarce resource and low transmission power.

2. Why it is important?


3. Why it is challenging?
This paper summarizes three approaches to harmonize coexistence across techonologies. 
-Avoid interferer frequencies.
-Use of partial packet recovery mechanisms.


3. What is the research question and hypothesis.
The paper presents a new channel metric to utilize the local knowledge of the wireless channel to discover high-power interferers.

poster: Exploiting Physical Layer Information to Mitigate Cross-Technology Interference Effects on Low-Power Wireless Networks
Problem: CTI reduce delivery ratio of low power wireless networks.
Solution: Packet recovery mechanism using phy info and time diversity of wireless channel to mitigate interference.
