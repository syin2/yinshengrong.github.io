The ACM fellow [Dina Katabi](http://people.csail.mit.edu/dina/) is definitely the leading person in wireless research. Their paper about LTE performance from an perspective with PHY layer inspired policy makers and users to make more efficient LTE usage and provide better connectivity.

I am curious about the platform they implemented in their experiment. The device called [USRP210](https://www.ettus.com/product/details/UN210-KIT).
