title: What's Twonet?
---

[Twonet](http://twonet.cs.uh.edu) is a large-scale sensor network testbed with dual-radio nodes. 
>Twonet has 100 Opal nodes with low power 32-bit ARM CPU and 2.4 GHz and 900 MHz radios. These nodes are managed by a network of 20 Raspberry Pi nodes at tier 2 and a PC server at tier 1. These nodes together provide a robust testbed for public access. 
Twonet represents a major addition to the collection of wireless sensor network testbeds that are publicly available. Wish to try, you can go [here](http://twonet.cs.uh.edu/webentry/).
